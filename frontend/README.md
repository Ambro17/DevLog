## TODO
 [x] Create Header and Footer vue components

 [ ] Migrate posts data to use graphql+strawberry (django? flask?)

## Improvements
 [x] Fine-tune site performance with lighthouse - Score of 95+
 [ ] Make lead layout finish before about page with some css property
 [ ] Auto detect user language and adjust accordingly

 [ ] Make header sticky

## Hacks
 [ ] Replace margin with div and border bottom to create extended space with background color
